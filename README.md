NOTE: I have not used AWS for the deployment of the application since I don not have valid credit card/debit card types for the same.  

This a React+Node js project for a coffee shop finder app. It helps users find coffee shops, locate them on maps, and purchase gift cards for discounts.  

Since this is a side project while purchasing gift cards please don't enter your real credit card numbers. instead, use 4242 4242 4242 4242. Use any date in the future and use any three-digit number as CVC
